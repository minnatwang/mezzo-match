<!-- you can see Jinja code where the {% and %} are. It does what you think it does. Also, between the {{ }} are variable names that the template gets when render_template is called with kwargs, we will see that in action later. (Tip: you can add this app.jinja_env.line_statement_prefix = '#' and just use # ( or any other prefix) once before a statement instead of having to do {% and %} every damn time.) -->
